## Environment Setup

Cocos Creator has many advantages such as dual-core support (C++ core and Web3D core), cross-platform capabilities, high performance, and low power consumption, which is why OpenTGX uses Cocos Creator as the technical foundation for the game client.

All project examples require the installation of the corresponding version of Cocos Creator to be opened.

### 1. Install Cocos Dashboard

Please proceed to the [Cocos Creator - Download](https://www.cocos.com/creator-download) to download the Cocos Dashboard.

> Cocos Creator uses TypeScript for scripting and requires the installation of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code. Please refer to the [official documentation of the Cocos engine for configuring your code editing environment](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/zh/scripting/coding-setup.html).

## Code Editor

Many code editors support TypeScript, but the author's development environment is Visual Studio Code. It is recommended that everyone uses the same development tool for coding. If you want to use a different code editor, please refer to the configuration of Visual Studio Code and set up the relevant environment parameters on your own.
